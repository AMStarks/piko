# Archived — OpenClaw (Clawd) scripts and config

These were used for the previous OpenClaw/Clawd + Telegram stack on Optimus. Piko now runs primarily via **WebChat + Llama 3.1 8B** (see `webchat-piko/` and `scripts/webchat-deploy/`).

Kept for reference or rollback only. To remove OpenClaw on Optimus: `scripts/webchat-deploy/PHASE3_RUNBOOK.md`.
