# User interests (for Piko's suggestions)

Edit this file to shape what Piko suggests when you ask "what's up?" or "what can you do?". Piko uses this only to guide follow-ups and tone; it does not invent facts.

## Format

**No strict format.** Use whatever is clear to you:

- **Bullets** (good for lists): e.g. `- **Projects:** Piko, Zeroa`
- **Short paragraphs** (good for themes): e.g. "I care about Cursor automation and proactive reminders."
- **Headings** (optional): e.g. `## What I care about`

Piko reads the whole file as context. Keep it short (a few bullets or a short paragraph is enough). Restart the WebChat server (and redeploy to Optimus if needed) after editing so the new content is loaded.

---

- **Projects:** Piko, Zeroa (and Cursor workflow).
- **Care about:** Autonomy, monitoring, Cursor automation, project sync, proactive reminders.
- **Prefer:** Concise, actionable suggestions.
